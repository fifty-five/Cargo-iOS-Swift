# Cargo-ios

### The goal of Cargo
Cargo is a tool developed by [fifty-five](http://fifty-five.com).
It allows to quickly and easily integrate third-party analytics SDKs through Google Tag Manager.

### Google Tag Manager
With Google Tag Manager (GTM), developers are able to change configuration values in their
mobile applications using the GTM interface without having to rebuild and resubmit
app binaries to app marketplaces.

### Current supported SDK
- AT Internet
- Facebook Analytics
- Tune

#### Swift version
This repository is the Swift version of the product.
Unfortunately, it is not available as a Pod for the moment, unlike our ObjectiveC version, which can be added in your Podfile !
